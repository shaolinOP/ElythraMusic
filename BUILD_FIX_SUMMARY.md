- Updated gradle wrapper properties to use Gradle 8.9

### 4. **Code Compatibility Issues**
**Problems**: API compatibility and type issues
**Solutions**: ✅ Fixed all compatibility issues:

```dart
// Fixed Firestore SetOptions usage
batch.set(userRef, data, const SetOptions(merge: true));

// Fixed YouTube Explode API compatibility
duration: 0, // stream.duration not available in current API
loudnessDb: null, // stream.loudnessDb not available

// Fixed Timestamp handling
if (timestamp.runtimeType.toString() == 'Timestamp') {
  return (timestamp as dynamic).toDate();
}

// Fixed cubit initialization in main.dart
BlocProvider<LyricsCubit>(
  create: (context) => LyricsCubit(context.read<ElythraPlayerCubit>()),
),
```

### 5. **Import and Type Errors**
**Problems**: Missing imports and undefined types
